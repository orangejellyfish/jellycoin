# jellycoin

A naive blockchain implementation in JavaScript for teaching purposes. It is not
recommended that you use any of the code in this project for production
purposes.

## Usage

There are a number of tags in the repository marking various stages of
development. If you are attending the "Do you want to build a blockchain"
workshop or conference session you can use these tags to jump ahead to the next
section if you need to.

To get started, clone the repository, run `npm install` in the root directory
and then `npm start` to start the HTTP server and P2P connection.
